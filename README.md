# SimpleServletCrud
Simple Servlet CRUD operations web application using Servlets and JDBC

1. Purpose:  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of building a web application using Java Servlets and JDBC. It focuses on implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data stored in a database.

2. Technologies Used: The project utilizes Servlets as the main component to handle HTTP requests and responses. JDBC is employed to establish a connection to the database and execute SQL queries. HTML forms are used to capture user input for data manipulation.

3. Components:
   - Servlets: Java classes responsible for handling different types of requests and performing CRUD operations.
   - HTML Forms: User interfaces created using HTML to collect and submit data to the servlets.
   - JDBC: Java Database Connectivity used to establish connections with the database and execute SQL queries.
   - Database: Backend storage to persist and manage application data.

4. Scope and Limitations: This project focuses on simplicity and does not include advanced features such as user authentication, validation, error handling, or styling. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of building web applications with Servlets and JDBC.

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern, with JSP serving as the View layer. This separation of concerns allows for cleaner code organization, with Servlets handling the application logic (Controller) and JSP handling the presentation logic (View).
